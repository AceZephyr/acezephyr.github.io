			<h1>So, you want to compete.</h1>
			<p>That's great! But there are some things you should know first.</p>
		</div>
		<br>
		<h2>Where do I find out about where competitions are?</h2>
		<p>You can find a list of all of them at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions">the World Cubing Association's Competitions page.</a></p>
		<p>You can also filter the very long list of competitions by continent or country with the "Region" selector.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>I've found a competition, how do I sign up for it?</h2>
		<p>There are two main methods of signing up for a competition in the USA, and competitions will probably use one or the other.</p>
		<p>1) CubingUSA:</p>
		<p>When you've found the competition, click the website link. Use the following instructions if the page has a blue header with the competition name.</p>
		<p>Go under the "Registration" tab and fill out all the information you can. If this is your first competition, skip the WCA ID.</p>
		<p>Make sure to fill in all the events you will be signed up for, in case there's a fee to participate in it.</p>
		<p>You will then get a PayPal link to pay the registration fee. You will probably have to pay this before you are signed up.</p>
		<p>2) WCA registration system</p>
		<p>This is a newer system, but still fairly difficult to register with. If the competition website link just opens the same page, use this.</p>
		<p>Click the "Register" tab off to the side or above. Follow the instructions until you have registered.</p>
		<p>To pay, go to the Registration Payment and Information tab. The PayPal link should be there.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>How do I compete?</h2>
		<p>You should be at least somewhat familiar with the WCA Regulations so you know how to compete. Watch <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/dPL3eV-A0ww">this video</a> for a tutorial.</p>
