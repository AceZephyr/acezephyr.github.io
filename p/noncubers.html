			<h1>For Non-cubers:</h1>
			<p>Hello! I am a speedcuber. I solve Rubik's Cubes fast.</p>
			<p>A lot of you may have a lot of misconceptions about us and the hobby of speedcubing.</p>
			<p>Here, I will clear up misconceptions, stereotypes, and other misinformation about us.</p>
			<p>Also, if you are writing a news article about cubing, <a href="#news">this</a> will show you how not to write one that makes us cringe.</p>
			<h1>Some Misconceptions:</h1>
			<p>First of all, no, just because you can solve a Rubik's cube doesn't mean you are amazing at math and science.</p>
			<p>It's more about recognizing patterns and reacting to them in the best way.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Second, no, the goal of solving a Rubik's cube is not to match all six sides. Even though that's the solved state, it's a horrible way to think about actually solving it.</p>
			<p>If you were to take apart a Rubik's Cube, you'd see that it's made up of pieces, not individual stickers.</p>
			<p>The twelve edge pieces will always have exactly two stickers each, and those stickers won't change.</p>
			<p>The eight corner pieces will always have exactly three stickers each, and those stickers won't change.</p>
			<p>Finally, the centers are all attached to each other, and they don't move relative to each other.</p>
			<p>Each piece has exactly one place it can be on the final cube and exactly one orientation it can be in.</p>
			<p>The challenge comes in moving those pieces to their solved position and orientation without disturbing the other pieces that have already been solved as quickly as possible.</p>
			<p>We've come up with a lot of methods that let us do this fast, and we get better at using those methods to get faster at solving the cube.</p>
			<p>Most people use one called CFOP. Most of the resources on my website are about CFOP. as that is also the method I use.</p>
			<p>In fact, the beginner's method under "How to solve a Rubik's Cube" is similar to CFOP, but broken down to be as easy as possible rather than as fast as possible.</p>
			<p>In fact, I encourage you to learn how to solve the cube, even if you don't plan on becoming a speedcuber.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Finally, it's spelled Rubik's, not Rubix, Rubiks, Rubicks, Rubics, or any other misspelling of the name of the Hungarian inventor of the cube, Ern≈ë Rubik.</p>
			<p>Rubik's Cube was a cube made by a person whose last name is Rubik. That is why it is called Rubik's Cube. It is his cube. He made it.</p>
			<h1 id="news">For the news:</h1>
			<p>If you're writing about a new Rubik's Cube World Record, it's also a good idea to understand the basics as to how a Rubik's Cube competition works.</p>
			<p>A group of competetors are called up to the solving area to have their cubes scrambled.</p>
			<p>They each perform five solves. They use a timer with two pads that begins after one of their hands is off its pad and ends when both pads are pressed again.</p>
			<p>Their average time for those five solves is calculated by ignoring the fastest and slowest solves and taking the mean of the remaining three.</p>
			<p>For each competetor's first solve, they all get the same scramble.</p>
			<p>For each competetor's second solve, they all get the same scramble, which is different from the first one. This repeats for all five solves.</p>
			<p>Before the solve, the comeptetor has fifteen seconds they are allowed to look at the puzzle for before starting the timer. This is called 'inspection'.</p>
