            <h2>Introduction to the Route</h2>
            <p>This is a guide to a route through The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of TIme meant for players that are beginning to speedrun the game. This route will use no glitches or difficult tricks while introducing you to the Glitchless speedrun.</p>
            <p>This route is expected to take anywhere between 5-8 hours to complete after you have learned it depending on how quickly you perform it and your skill at movement through the game.</p>
            <h3>Versions of Ocarina of Time</h3>
            <p>There are several versions of the game you can play on that each have their advantages and disadvantages, however none of these are significant enough to affect the version you should play on when you are first learning the game.</p>
            <p>When it comes to language, the Japanese version of the game is easily the fastest version that is easily accessable. You can purchase an N64 Japanese cartridge of Ocarina of Time online or softmod your Wii to install a Japanese version of Ocarina of Time onto it. However, if you only have an English NTSC version of Ocarina of Time, there is no reason not to use it. The PAL version of Ocarina of Time runs at about 5/6 of the speed of the NTSC version, and as such should be avoided if possible.</p>
            <p>The original Nintendo 64 version of the game has the most lag and slowest loading times. This lag is strong enough to waste multiple minutes throughout a whole run compared to the fastest versions of the game.</p>
            <p>The GameCube release of the game has less lag than the N64 version, but it has slower saves and resets, and these will be used during the run.</p>
            <p>The Wii Virtual Console version of the game is my personal favorite. It has less lag than the N64 version and GC versions, allows you to use the GameCube Controller (or Nintendo 64 controller with an adapter), and it is extremely easy to get onto any Wii by softmodding it.</p>
            <p>While the Wii U Virtual Console version of OoT technically has faster loading times than the Wii VC version, its huge input lag and bad controller options make it a version not preferred by runners. There is no controller that works with it that has notches on the analog stick, which are very useful when running this game at a higher level. It's also difficult to get the Japanese version if you do not own a Japanese Wii U.</p>
            <p>You can also play on an Emulator. You must use Project64 v1.7 if you use an emulator. I would recommend binding A and B to two face buttons and C-Left and C-Right to the other two. Bind Z to the left trigger or bumper, R and C-Down to the right trigger and bumper, and C-Up to moving the right stick up. This button scheme is many times better than having to use the stick for C-items, and is how the GC, Wii, and Wii U versions of the game map their buttons.</p>
            <h3>Navigating the Japanese File Select menu</h3>
            <p>Below the three files (ファイル１，ファイル２，ファイル３) are コピー (Copy),　消す　(Erase), and オプション (Options).</p>
            <p>The Options menu has Sound and Z-Targeting options. </p>
            <p>The Sound options are ステレオ (Stereo), モノラル　(Mono), ヘッドホン (Headphones), and スラウンド (Surround).</p>
            <p>The Z-Targeting options are スイッチ (Switch) and ホールド (Hold).</p>
            <p>I would recommend using Hold targeting for the run. Hold Targeting makes it easy to stop targeting things, and Link in general moves slower when you are targeting something.</p>
            <p>In case you don't know the difference between Hold and Switch targeting, you press Z to target and press Z to untarget with Switch targeting, but you press Z to target and release Z to untarget with Hold targeting.</p>
            <p>When you begin, delete the first save file or copy it to another file if you don't want to lose its progress.</p>
            <p>Start a new save file. If you want to go as fast as possible, name your file only one character, so it takes the least amount of time to scroll on screen.</p>
            <h3>Link's Movement</h3><p>Link has several options for movement in Ocarina of Time.</p>
            <p>Walking backwards by holding target and down is </p>
